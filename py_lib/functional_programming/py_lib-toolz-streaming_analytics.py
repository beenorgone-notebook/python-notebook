# SELECT name, balance FROM accounts WHERE balance > 150

# Functional version with pipeline and curry

# II. SPLIT-APPLY-COMBINE WITH `GROUPBY` AND `REDUCEBY`:
# 1. Split the dataset into groups by some property
# 2. Reduce each of the groups with some synopsis function

# In Memory Split-Apply-Combine
# SELECT gender, SUM(balance) FROM accounts GROUP BY gender;
print(groupby(get(3), accounts))
# {'M': [(2, 'Bob', 200, 'M'), (3, 'Charlie', 150, 'M'), (4, 'Dennis', 50, 'M')], 'F': [(1, 'Alice', 100, 'F'), (5, 'Edith', 300, 'F')]}
print(pipe(accounts, groupby(get(3)),
           valmap(compose(sum, pluck(2)))))
# {'M': 400, 'F': 400} (pluck item )


# Streaming Split-Apply-Combine
# the groupby operation is not streaming and so this approach is limited
# to datasets that can fit comfortably into memory.
# to achieves streaming split-apply-combine use `reduceby()`

# The `reduceby` operation takes a key function,
# like `get(3)` or `lambda x: x[3]`, and a binary operator like
# `add` or `lesser = lambda acc, x: acc if acc < x else x`.
# It successively applies the key function to each item in succession,
# accumulating running totals for each key by combining each new value
# with the previous using the binary operator.
# It canâ€™t accept full reduction operations like `sum` or `min` as
# these require access to the entire group at once. Here's an example:
def iseven(n):
    return n % 2 == 0


def add(x, y):
    return x + y

print(reduceby(iseven, add, [1, 2, 3, 4]))  # {False: 4, True: 6}
# The even numbers are added together (2 + 4 = 6) into group True, and
# the odd numbers are added together (1 + 3 = 4) into group False.

# Here is the solution for our accounts example that
# adds up the balances for each group:
binop = lambda total, acc: total + acc[2]
print(reduceby(get(3), binop, accounts), 0)  # {'M': 400, 'F': 400}


# SEMI-STREAMING `JOIN`
# We register multiple datasets together with `join`.
# Consider a second dataset storing addresses by ID
addresses = [(1, '123 Main Street'),  # id, address
             (2, '5 Adams Way'),
             (5, '34 Rue St Michel')]

# SELECT accounts.name, addresses.address FROM accounts, addresses
# WHERE accounts.id = addresses.id;

result = join(first, accounts,
              first, addresses)

for ((id, name, bal, gender), (id, address)) in result:
    print((id, name, bal, gender), (id, address))
    print((name, address))

# toolz.itertoolz.join(leftkey, leftseq, rightkey, rightseq, left_default='__no__default__', right_default='__no__default__')
# This is a semi-streaming operation. The LEFT sequence is fully evaluated
# and placed into memory. The RIGHT sequence is evaluated lazily and so
# can be arbitrarily large.


# `JOIN` ON ARBITRARY FUNCTIONS / DATA
def isodd(x):
    return x % 2 == 1

print(list(join(iseven, [1, 2, 3, 4],
                isodd, [7, 8, 9])))
