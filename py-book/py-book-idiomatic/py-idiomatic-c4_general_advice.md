 ## Avoid Reinventing the Wheel

### Learn the Contents of the Python Standard Library

Code that unknowingly reimplements functionality in the standard library is perhaps the clearest signal of a novice Python programmer.

### Get to know PyPI (the Python Package Index)

If Python's standard library doesn't have a package relevant to your particular problem, try PyPi. Not all packages are created equal (or equally maintained), so be sure to check when the package was last updated. A package with documentation hosted externally on a site like [ReadTheDocs](http://www.readthedocs.org) is a good sign, as is one for which the source is available on a site like GitHub or Bitbucket.

## Modules of Note

### Learn the contents of the `itertools` module

### Use functions in the `os.path` module when working with directory paths
